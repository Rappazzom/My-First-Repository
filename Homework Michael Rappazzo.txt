# Perimeter of a Triangle
# Perimeter = side a + side b + base
side_1 = 4 # assigning variable to side_1
side_2 = 10 # assigning variable to side_2
base = 6 # assigning variable to base
perimeter = side_1 + side_2 + base #Formula to get perimeter
print("The perimeter of your triangle is", perimeter) # this prints the perimeter of a triangle

print('Is side a greater than side 2, the answer is', side_1>side_2) # this tells you if side a is greater than side 2

print('Is the base equal to side 1, the answer is', base==side_1) # this tells you if the base is equal to side 1
